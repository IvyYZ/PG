pedestrian detection testset 

called Playground (PG) for low-quality image detection. Images of PG are shot by two different views of cameras, pedestrian images are taken at different periods, including day and night. There are a total of 5,752 images with 31,041 annotations. The average size of the pedestrian is 41*87 and the image size is 480*640.

The labeling format is .xml format, which is the same as the PASCAL VOC data set format. It can be easily trained and tested on common target detection algorithms (i.e. Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, etc.).
