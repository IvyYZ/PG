![Image](https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/26/DwdauT.png)
The different test sets for the dataset are shown in the figure above.

Playground (PG) for low-quality image detection. Images of PG are shot by two different views of cameras, pedestrian images are taken at different periods, including day and night. There are a total of 5,752 labeled images with 31,041 annotations. The average size of the pedestrian is 41*87 and the image size is 480x640.

The labeling format is .xml format, which is the same as the PASCAL VOC data set. It can be easily trained and tested on common target detection algorithms (i.e. Faster R-CNN, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, etc.).
